Do some unit tests for workflow.
================================

:Test-Layer: functional 

Start with the reverse mapping of CREATING AND PUBLISHED
-------------------------------------------------------
   
   >>> from uvcsite.workflow.basic_workflow import CREATED, PUBLISHED, PROGRESS, titleForState
   
Is the constant CREATED really 0 and PUBLISHED 1 ?
   
   >>> CREATED
   0

   >>> PUBLISHED
   1

   >>> PROGRESS
   2

Do we get the right title for CREATED in this case 0

   >>> print titleForState(CREATED)
   Entwurf
   
Is the title for  PUBLISHED "gesendet"?

   >>> print titleForState(PUBLISHED)
   gesendet

State Progress

   >>> print titleForState(PROGRESS)
   in Verarbeitung

What happens if we put an unknown State in the Method.

   >>> unknown = 9 
   >>> print titleForState(unknown)
   unbekannt

Simple test for the basic setup of the workflow Utility
-------------------------------------------------------

   >>> from uvcsite.workflow.basic_workflow import create_workflow
   >>> from hurry.workflow.interfaces import IWorkflow
   >>> workflow = create_workflow()

does the workflow provide the right Interface

   >>> IWorkflow.providedBy(workflow)
   True
